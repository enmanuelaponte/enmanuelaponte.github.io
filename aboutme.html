        <p> My name is Enmanuel Aponte and I was on April 16,2002 and born in Dominican Republic. I gained an interset in technology at a young age. ScriptEd has helped devlop my coding skills. I currently go to Cristo Rey New York High School and junior. I do not plan on pursuing a coding career, but I do it for fun. </p>
